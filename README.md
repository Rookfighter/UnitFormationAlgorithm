## About

UnitFormationAlgorithm (UFA) is an educational project to test some algorithms to put RTS-like
units in formations and let them move around.

to execute cmake to build the binary.

## Dependencies

* UFA uses SFML 2.1 for visualization (get it [here](http://www.sfml-dev.org/))
  * The dynamic libraries have to be placed in one of the directories ```lib/SFML-2.1/bin``` or ```lib/SFML-2.1/lib```
  * The include files have to be place in the directory ```lib/SFML-2.1/include```
  * on Linux libjpeg62 has to be installed Ubuntu: ```sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-dev```
